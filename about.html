          <p>I grew up in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=skipton+victoria+australia" target="_blank"
              class="hyp-link">Skipton</a>. Haven’t heard of it? That’s probably because it’s a small town in country
            Victoria, Australia. 600 people small.</p>

          <p>I didn’t want to be a mechanic like everyone else in my family, neither did Mum & Dad (thanks for that
            guys!). But there isn't that much diversity activities available in a small country town, especially at a
            young age, so I stayed inside, played <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Old_School_RuneScape"
              target="_blank" class="hyp-link">RuneScape</a>, and tinkered with and broke our computer</p>

          <p>At the start of high school around age 12 (which I attended in Beaufort, another small town) I was
            introduced into RuneScape Private Servers. As a by-product of my boredom and an inquisitive nature I learned
            these servers were developed using Java, and being an open source community I was able to download, compile
            and run my own local versions. Slowly by copy, pasting and replacing I was introduced into programming.
            After playing around with a few different languages and grasping the fundamentals I stumbled across the
            perfect cross-over of passion and pleasure; <strong><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2" class="hyp-link"
                target="_blank">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a></strong>. I found myself involved in a community of
            people dedicated to deobfuscating, modifying then recompiling the game's code to develop our own extensions
            and creations. One modification I was developing conjured up quite a following which lead me to start
            dedicating more and more energy into it as what I was doing quickly evolved from a hobby into what I refer
            to today as my passion. My final year at high school was a bit of a struggle as I spending more energy on
            programming than my actual studies, but I was able to complete the year and receive my VCE (Victorian
            Certificate of Education).</p>
